description("http://animals.mom.me/newts-life-cycle-6838.html", life_cycle, "newt", "::stage Egg:: Newt eggs are encased in a gel-like substance rather than a hard shell. Adult females release eggs one at a time and store them in clusters ranging from a handful to several dozen in size. Adults often take an active role in defending their eggs after depositing them. Mothers may curl their body around the eggs to provide protection. Some newt species even wrap leaves around each egg individually to camouflage them, according to San Diego Zoo. Newt eggs are small: some measure only a millimeter or two in diameter. Mom usually anchors her eggs to underwater plants and other structures to keep them safe. ::stage Tadpole:: Newts that hatch from submerged eggs usually emerge as aquatic larvae with fishlike tails and gills that allow them to breathe beneath the water's surface. Not all newt species have an aquatic or 'tadpole' phase. This tadpole stage tends to be short, except in fully aquatic species. Eastern newt (Notophthalmus viridescens) larvae spend only a few months as tadpoles, but they remain in the terrestrial larval stage for years before fully maturing, according to Island Creek Elementary School. Some newts spend their entire juvenile life as tadpoles and never go through a terrestrial stage. ::stage Eft:: Many newts progress to a terrestrial larval stage following their brief time as a tadpole. They are called 'efts' at this point in their life cycle. Even newts that are aquatic as eggs and adults may spend several years on land as an eft between the two stages. The land-bound juveniles are still amphibious, so they require environments with shade and moisture. The efts tend to hide under stones, logs, fallen leaves and other forms of natural shelter in environments with damp soil, according to the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department. ::stage Adult:: Adult newts are versatile. Most have both legs and wide tails, so the adults can walk on land or swim in the water. However, individual species show a propensity for either terrestrial or aquatic environments and spend most of their time in one of them. The smooth newt (Lissotriton vulgaris) spends most of its adult life on land, but courtship and mating occur exclusively in aquatic environments during the appropriate season, according to the Online Field Guide. The reverse is true for other newt species, including the Eastern newt. ").

description("http://texastreeid.tamu.edu/content/howTreesGrow/", life_cycle, "tree", "::stage seed:: Think about which came first - the tree, or the seed? Regardless of what you believe, the more you learn about them, trees are simply amazing. Seeds come in a wide variety of shapes, weights, colors, and sizes, depending on the species. All seeds develop from male and female parts of the trees producing fruits but not all of them are easily recognizable or edible. Some seeds are contained in a protective nut like an acorn, pecan, or hickory. Other seeds are found in fleshy fruits, like the black cherry, mulberry, or persimmon. The fruit of a pine is a cone and the seed is winged and resembles a miniature helicopter when falling in the wind from an open pinecone. Wind, water, animals, and people disperse seeds to a wide range of landscapes including the forest floor, open fields, yards, rocky slopes, and roadsides. Anywhere the conditions are favorable for germination, seeds will sprout and grow. ::stage sprout:: An embryo is within each seed, but not all seeds will germinate. Favorable environmental conditions enable the embryo to grow, expand, and break through the seed coat using the stored food supply of the seed for the necessary energy to grow. The root grows downward to the soil to anchor the sprout and search for water and nutrients, while the sprout emerges from the ground seeking sunlight. Ideally, the sprout will find light and then the leaves, needles, or scales will develop further to allow the tree to make its own food through photosynthesis. ::stage seedling:: The sprout persistently grows and begins to develop woody characteristics. The soft green stem begins to harden, change color, and develop a thin protective bark. Leaves or needles develop and continue to search out light. The root grows and branches down and out resembling an upside down underground tree with a flattened top. The majority of the tree's roots are in the upper portions of soil to absorb available water and nutrients but also to breathe. Like us, tree roots need oxygen or they will die. The seedling must compete with other trees and plants for its share of nutrients, water, sunlight, and space. Other threats include fire, flood, drought, ice and snow, disease, insect attacks, and the threat of being consumed by animals. At this seedling stage, the tree is most susceptible to being killed. If it can survive these early years without harm, the seedling is well on its way to the next phase in the cycle. ::stage Sapling:: A sapling is a small tree usually between 1 and 4 inches in diameter at 4.5 feet. This is the standard height where a tree's diameter is measured - diameter at breast height (DBH). Typically, a sapling is the size of a tree that is growing in a commercial nursery for transplanting to your yard. In this juvenile state, the tree is not mature enough to reproduce. However, the sapling is growing rapidly. The sapling encounters similar types of competition and threats to that of a seedling. ::stage Mature:: With favorable conditions, a sapling will continue to develop into a mature tree. During this mature stage in the cycle, each tree will grow as much as its species and site conditions will permit. In addition, flowers develop, reproduction ensues, fruits form, and seed dispersal can now occur. The optimum time to harvest trees for forest products beneficial to people is during this stage in the lifecycle. In Texas, the majority of products are made from southern yellow pine (loblolly, longleaf, shortleaf, and slash). Hardwoods such as ash, hickory, mesquite, pecan, and oak are also used but southern yellow pine is the main commercially grown species to meet public demand for wood products such as those listed below. A few of the products made from Texas trees include: paper, dimensional lumber, cabinets, molding, doors, pallets, boxes, crates, trusses, fireplace mantels, furniture, oriented strand board (OSB), flooring, crossties, joists, decking, log homes, posts, poles, cooking wood, fencing, fuel, interior finishing, pilings, bridges, animal bedding, mulch, heavy construction timbers, charcoal, shingles, and many more. If a tree is never harvested, over the course of time it continues to provide many other benefits, but eventually will begin to decline. ::stage Decline:: At this point, the tree's survival is determined more by external stresses rather than the tree's vigor. These stresses take a toll on the tree making it more susceptible to insects and diseases, and it eventually succumbs to a causal agent or the pressures of competition from other more vigorously growing plants adjacent to the tree. The end result is no surprise. ::stage Snag:: The life span of a tree is as wide-ranging as the number of tree varieties, yet death is inevitable. Usually it is a combination of factors that finally overcome a tree and cause it to die. Injury, drought stress, followed by disease, rot, root dieback, coupled with a lightning strike and insect infestation is just one of many scenarios. However, sometimes it can be just one factor serious enough to cause mortality. Yet, the cycle does not end here. A standing dead tree, also called a snag, still plays a vital role in the life cycle. Decomposition takes time. A snag slowly breaks down and returns nutrients to the soil as small limbs, bark, and branches fall to the ground. The snag also provides habitat, cover, and food for wildlife and insects. In turn, animals, insects, and fungi help break down the tree. Eventually, the snag will fall to the ground and gradually return nutrients to the soil where they are taken up again by other trees by providing for their growth. And, the cycle begins anew. ").

description("https://longleafalliance.org/what-is-longleaf/the-tree/life-stages", life_cycle, "longleaf pine", "::stage Seedling Stage:: After falling from the tree in October to late November, winged seeds whirl to the forest floor and await adequate moisture before germination.  In heavy mast years, a rain shortly after seed fall will yield a green blanket of germinants on the forest floor.  Seeds either germinate within a few weeks after falling or they die. Although seeds will germinate almost anywhere (on rocks, logs, forest mulch), they generally need to land on mineral soil to survive subsequent droughty periods.  During this first stage, the seedlings are very susceptible to fire, drought and predation and will take upwards to a year to reach the next life stage. ::stage Grass Stage:: The grass stage is an inconspicuous yet unique stage of a longleaf pine's life history where the seedling resembles a clump of grass more than a tree, hence the name.  During the grass stage, the growing tip (bud) of the tree is protected under a thick arrangement of needles at ground level. When fires sweep through, the needles may burn but the tip of the bud remains protected.  New needles quickly replace those that were burned off.  During the grass stage, longleaf pine seedlings are virtually immune to fire.  At the grass stage, although the tree will not be growing upwards, the seedling will be putting down an impressive root system underground.  Also during the grass stage, longleaf may become infected with a fungus called brown spot needle blight. Brown spot causes the needles to brown, fall off, and hamper growth.   Repeated defoliation will cause the seedling to die. The grass stage may last anywhere from one to seven years depending on the degree of competition with other plants for resources.  Rare instances of 20 years have been documented. ::stage Bottle Brush Stage:: When the diameter of the root collar (that area right at ground level) reaches 1-inch, the longleaf grass stage will begin to initiate height growth. Beginning in about late February to mid-March, a single, white growing tip will emerge upwards from the protective sheath of needles. This white tip, called a candle, may grow a few feet in just a few months.  By about late May, green needles begin to emerge from the candle and the candle begins to turn scaly and brown as bark begins to form.  At this point, the longleaf is growing proportionally more in height then it is in diameter.  There are no branches spreading out horizontally during this time causing the tree to look like a three to four-foot bottlebrush.  By growing rapidly in a short period of time, the seedling is able to secure an advantageous position to gather sunlight and to get its growing tip above the frequent fires.  However, during this stage of growth, longleaf pine trees are slightly more vulnerable to fire.  It may take a year or so before the bark thickens enough to withstand most fires.  The longleaf may remain in this stage for a couple of years. ::stage Sapling Stage:: When the longleaf reaches about 6 to 10 feet in height, lateral branches begin to emerge and signal the beginning of the sapling stage. Diameter increases and bark thickens modestly, but the tree continues to grow in height at upwards of 3 feet per year.  Around late February to mid-March white growing tips can be seen extending upwards from the tufted needles at the end of the branches.  As the tree grows taller and the bark becomes thicker, the longleaf becomes less susceptible to fire.  After the tree reaches 8 feet in height and about 2 inches in diameter at ground level, it becomes very robust and is rarely killed by fire.  The tree will remain in this stage for several years. ::stage Mature Stage:: Somewhere around 30 years after height growth initiation, trees begin to produce cones with fertile seeds. As the forest begins to mature, lower limbs may be shed or pruned off by fire. The trunk of the tree begins to fill out into a straight, relatively branch free tree that resembles a living telephone pole (in fact, many longleaf pines are sold for telephone poles). On more fertile soils, the tree may continue to grow in height up to 110 feet. On poorer soils, the tree may only grow to 60 feet. After about 70 -100 years longleaf essentially ceases height growth. During the later stages of this period, trees may begin to show signs of decay and rot. In particular, longleaf pine reaching 80 years in age may become infected with a fungus called red heart that causes the otherwise dense heart of the tree to become punky, soft, sappy and full of small channels ").

Eggs are incubated by one or both parents for a period of time until the embryo inside has developed into a chick which is ready to hatch. A chick may have to work for hours or even days to break through the shell of its egg. Most birds have a small bump near the tip of their beak called an egg tooth to help them hatch. ::stage hatchling:: a hatchling is a bird that has just hatched and may be almost completely naked apart from some fine down. Hatchlings eyes may not open and it is unlikely to be able to care for itself. The term hatchling is usually used to refer to altricial chicks which are undeveloped and unable to move around. Hatchlings will stay in the nest for some time and will rely on their parents for feeding and to keep them warm. Precocial birds such as ducks and owls are relatively mature when they are born and are sometimes able to feed themselves and leave the nest soon after. ::stage nestling:: nestlings are chicks that are a few days old and are covered in soft down. There may be signs of flight feathers and nestlings eyes may have opened but they will be unable to leave the nest and will still rely on their parents for food and warmth. ::stage fledgling:: chicks that have developed flight feathers and wing muscles are known as fledglings. fledglings will have started to explore outside the nest but will still be under the care of their parents. Fledglings are fairly awkward and only able to fly for short distances but will be active and able to hop about. The length of time it takes for a chick to fledge varies between species. For example it takes 6 months before the chicks of the great frigatebird fledge and their parents feed them for a further 14 months. ::stage juvenile:: a juvenile bird is at the awkward teenage stage of being a bird. Juvenile birds will have left the nest and will be fully independent. juvenile bird will be in their first plumage and can look similar to adult birds although they may be duller with less defined markings. Out in the field it can be difficult to identify a juvenile bird and for most species of birds the length of time they are a juvenile is very short. ::stage subadult:: subadult birds are young birds that are older than juveniles but have still not developed adult plumage and are not sexually mature. Some birds such as house sparrows will become sexually mature at just a few months whereas larger birds such as golden eagles won't become sexually mature until they are 4 or 5 years old. The terms immature and subadult are interchangeable by many ornithologists although immature can be used to refer to any bird that isn't an adult. ::stage adult:: adult birds are sexually mature and are able to reproduce. adult birds will be in full adult plumage which may change depending on the season. Some birds have brighter plumage with clearer markings when in breeding season while in other birds, such as puffins, the shape and colour of their bills may change. ").

A toad, however, starts out as an egg. No - not like the egg that you scramble in the morning for breakfast. Toad eggs are surrounded by a clear, jelly-like substance. When a mother toad is ready to have her babies, she will lay her eggs in a stream or a pond in a long strand. Toads have been known to lay hundreds and even thousands of eggs. In the middle of a toad egg, you can see a tiny black dot. Eventually, this little black dot will become a toad! Right now, it is an embryo (an unborn baby). The embryo will continue to grow and grow until it is ready to be born. Some of the eggs will not make it, and the journey will end for them here. ::stage tadpole:: The eggs hatch into tadpoles, or 'pollywogs'. Tadpoles have a tail and gills, which means that they need to live in water to breathe. Tadpoles have special jaws that they use to begin eating algae. The algae provide the nutrition the adpoles need to grow healthy and strong. ::stage toadlet:: Think of the third stage as the teenage years of the toad. While the toadlets have developed legs and almost look like toads, they aren't quite there yet. This is the toadlet stage. Toadlets have sticky tongues that they use to catch their food. They also have developed lungs at this stage, allowing them to breathe air instead of water. While toadlets are able to survive on land, they need to go back in the water frequently because they are easily dehydrated. ::stage toad:: The final stage is here! What started out as a little egg has now blossomed into an adult toad. The adult toad has two back legs and two front legs that it uses to jump around the land. The adults tail is gone and its lungs are fully developed. Now it is time for the toad to continue the life cycle and make babies of its own, so the adult toad will start looking for love. Well, not exactly - in most of the animal world, scientists call it 'trying to find a mate.' This starts pretty early, as females are normally ready to have toad babies around the age of three and the males around the age of two. You'll know when it's mating season for toads, especially if you live in a tropical area. After a summer rainstorm, the male toads let out loud mating calls in hopes of attracting lady toads. The female toad will lay eggs, and the cycle begins all over again. ").

Even that massive pine tree growing near the park began as a tiny seed. Seeds contain the beginning of new life for a plant. Seeds come in many different shapes and sizes, and they all grow into the parent plant that they came from. Many seeds begin in the flowers of plants. Seeds are covered by an outer layer called a seed coat, which protects the delicate seed from harm. The seeds are spread by wind, water or animals to new places. When the seed finds a place to land, it begins to grow. This begins the plant's life cycle. A life cycle is a series of stages a living thing goes through as it grows and changes over the course of its life. ::stage seedling:: Once the seed finds the right combination of soil, sunlight and water, it begins to germinate. When a seed germinates, it begins to grow and starts the process of making a new plant. ::stage seedling:: The new plant breaks out of the seed coat and starts to grow into a small plant called a seedling. The seedling also begins to spread roots into the soil. Seedlings are small and usually have just a few leaves. Seedlings use the sun's energy to make their own food, and they soak up water from rain and nutrients from the soil. Seedlings may not look much like their parent plant at this point and have yet to develop flowers or fruit. ::stage young adult plant:: As the plant continues to grow, it soon becomes a young adult plant. Young adult plants are thicker, taller and stronger than seedlings. They have more leaves and deeper roots. Young adult plants begin to look more like their parent plants, but they're still not old enough to have their own flowers, fruit or seeds. ::stage adult plant:: When the plant has grown to a mature size, it's called an adult plant and is ready to make its own seeds. Some plants have flowers that produce pollen. The pollen helps seeds grow. Some plants can produce seeds in cones, like pine trees, and others produce them in flowers and fruit, like apple trees. Once an adult plant has produced seeds, it will spread its seeds the same way its parent plant did--by wind, water or animals--and the cycle repeats itself. The length of the plant's life cycle depends on the kind of plant it is. Some plants, such as tomato plants, have short, quick life cycles. Other plants, like pine trees, have life cycles that last many years. ").

The adult female praying mantis lays 100 to 400 eggs after fertilization. The eggs are laid safely on a firm leaf or stem with a liquid that hardens to be a protective sac structure known as ootheca. The ootheca is a protective casing (very hard and able to survive extreme weather changes) in which the eggs will stay throughout the winter. In mid-spring when the temperatures are warm, the nymphs will hatch when the egg cases crack. ::stage Nymph:: Initially, the hatched nymphs stay around the egg casing for a while. It's during this nymph period that the mantis try to feed on each other. After spreading out, the nymphs will begin to hunt for small insects such as fruit flies. Nymphs undergo a series of repeated stages of growth in their development known as instars. At each stage, the nymphs shed off their exoskeleton through a process called molting to allow development of body segments leading to an increase in body size. Molting takes place about six times before the nymphs can begin the next stage life. Nymphs are vulnerable as prey to other large predators such as the bats, birds and spiders, and not all nymphs survive this stage. ::stage Adolescents:: Adolescent mantises are larger in size than nymphs. Adoloscent mantises shed their exoskeletons occasionally, a feature that differentiates them from adult mantises. Mantises tend to be sluggish before they molt and will rarely feed during this period. Molting increases their vulnerability as prey as it takes a few hours and the mantis remains at one place. The molting process ends at the beginning of summer, when it has grown to be a mature adult. ::stage Adult:: Full-grown mantises are normally between 1 to 6 inches in length, and are different in size depending on their species. Female mantises can be distinguished from males as they have heavier abdomens. In addition to small insects, mantises will prey on small nesting birds, mice, lizards and tree frogs. Praying mantises have an interesting behavior when they mate in that the female eats the head of the male mantis as it reduces his sex drive. After mating she feeds on the rest of male's body. The female mantis usually dies after laying eggs. ").

The web of the black widow is random and messy looking, not symmetrical and neat like some spiders.  Female black widows can mate and lay three or more egg sacs a season.  Hundreds of eggs are laid in each egg sac.  The mother black widow guards the egg sac for up to a month until it hatches. When the baby spiders hatch they begin to eat one another for nutrients, so only a few from each egg sac survive.  The baby survivors leave the egg sac within a couple of days of hatching.  When the baby spiders leave they often 'balloon'.  The baby spiders spin a long filament of web and it catches a breeze and floats them away from home. The baby spiders molt several times over the summer and fall.  Over winter the baby spiders mature. In the spring the mature spiders are ready to find their own mates and start the cycle over again.  Most black widows live only one year, but they can live up to three years. ").

After mating, a fertile female will lay eggs almost continuously. The female will use her ovipositor, a tube-like organ, to deposit eggs in whatever damp substrate is available. A female can easily lay 100 eggs, and sometimes as many as 200 eggs, during her life. A cricket begins its life in an egg. After about 14 days, the crcicket will have developed into a nymph. The crcicket will break the egg capsule and dig out of the substrate. ::stage Nymph:: Nymphs look like small versions of adult crickets with a few differences. Nymphs are not as developed so initially do not have wings and females do not have ovipositors. These young crickets often become prey for larger crickets and other insects. In order to grow, a nymph has to shed its hard exoskeleton. This process is called molting and happens 8 to 10 times. The new exoskeleton is milky white and soft until it hardens in a few hours. A nymph will begin growing its wings after about a month. ::stage Adult:: Once a cricket reaches maturity its wings are fully developed and it only has two goals: eating and mating. A male will attempt to attract fertile females. Once mating has occurred, a female will spend her time finding suitable places to lay her eggs. ").

The female then produces large eggs, which after releasing from the ovary are fertilized by the sperms from the oviduct. The female snake lays the fertilized eggs (about 10 - 15 in number) in shallow holes or under the rocks. The outer covering of snake's egg is not hard, rather it resembles a soft leather. The female snake guards and looks after the eggs till they hatch into young ones. ::stage Young Snake:: Some snake species warm the eggs by twitching their muscles, so as to speed up the hatching process. The juvenile snake comes out of the egg, by biting the egg cover with the help of egg tooth. Until then, the snake obtains nutrition from the egg yolk. A young snake is known as a snakelet. A just hatched one can be called a hatchling. Baby snakes feed on small reptiles and rodents. A young snake may shed its skin upto 4 times a year. ::stage Adult Snake:: After the juvenile snakes emerge, they attain maturity within 2 - 4 years. One of the major distinguishing features between a young snake and an older snake is the frequency of molting per year. In case of a juvenile snake, skin shedding takes place about four times a year, whereas an adult snake sheds only once a year, at the most, two times per year. However, unlike insects in which molting allows the growth of the organism, renewal of skin in snakes does not have a significant role in their growth. ").

Although crocodiles are typically aggressive predators, they nurture and care for their babies before and after their birth. A female crocodile lays her eggs in a hole she makes along a riverbed or the shoreline, nearly two months after mating. This is called nesting, which is the process of building a shelter to deposit the eggs in while they develop towards hatching. The number of eggs the crocodile lays varies on the species of crocodile. (Species are a group of living things that can make more of itself. In total, there are fourteen species of crocodiles found around the world.) For example, the Nile crocodile deposits anywhere between 25 and 80 eggs, the saltwater crocodile lays 40-60 eggs, and the American crocodile 30-70 eggs. Unlike most reptiles, who leave after depositing their eggs, the work of crocodile parents is far from being over. For the next three months, the female crocodile closely guards the eggs and the male stays nearby to protect the female and her eggs from predators. ::stage Young:: Have you ever had a friend who looks just like their parents, only smaller? This stage of the life cycle is called 'young'. When the babies hatch, they look just like their parents, but there is one obvious difference: their size. Some adult crocodile species grow up to 17 feet long; however, the babies are typically only 12 inches. Once the babies are born, the mother helps her babies to the water by carrying them gently in her mouth. The young crocodiles live under the safeguard of their mother for nearly two years. During this time, they learn to hunt and care for themselves. ::stage Adult:: As the crocodile gets older, it continues to grow about one foot every year. The diet of a crocodile also grows, as it develops up to 60 sharp teeth, for hunting larger prey. The muscles that snap the jaw closed have tremendous strength, helping them defeat big animals. Adult crocodiles seek out mates, to make more of their own species. Male crocodiles splash, grunt, growl, and slap their snouts against the water to gain the attention of a female. A female can go through the nesting process up to 45 times in her lifetime. Crocodiles have rather long life cycles and can live to be 60 years old. ").

description("https://www.mosquito.org/page/lifecycle", life_cycle, "mosquito", "::stage Egg:: Eggs are laid one at a time or attached together to form 'rafts.' Eggs float on the surface of the water. In the case of Culex and  Culiseta species, the eggs are stuck together in rafts of up to 200. Anopheles, Ochlerotatus, and Aedes, as well as many other genera, do not make egg rafts, but lay their eggs singly. Culex,  Culiseta, and Anopheles lay their eggs on the water surface while many Aedes and Ochlerotatus lay their eggs on damp soil that will be flooded by water. Most eggs hatch into larvae within 48 hours; others might withstand subzero winters before hatching. Water is a necessary part of larvae habitat. ::stage Larva:: The larva (plural - larvae) lives in the water and comes to the surface to breathe. Larvae shed (molt) their skins four times, growing larger after each molt. Most larvae have siphon tubes for breathing and hang upside down from the water surface. Anopheles larvae do not have a siphon and lie parallel to the water surface to get a supply of oxygen through a breathing opening.  Coquillettidia and Mansonia larvae attach to plants to obtain their air supply. The larvae feed on microorganisms and organic matter in the water. During the fourth molt the larva changes into a pupa. ::stage Pupa:: The pupal stage is a resting, non-feeding stage of development, but pupae are mobile, responding to light changes and moving (tumble) with a flip of their tails towards the bottom or protective areas. This is the time the mosquito changes into an adult. This process is similar to the metamorphosis seen in butterflies when the butterfly develops - while in the cocoon stage - from a caterpillar into an adult butterfly. In Culex species in the southern United States this takes about two days in the summer. When development is complete, the pupal skin splits and the adult mosquito (imago) emerges. ::stage Adult:: The newly emerged adult rests on the surface of the water for a short time to allow itself to dry and all its body parts to harden. The wings have to spread out and dry properly before the adult can fly. Blood feeding and mating does not occur for a couple of days after the adults emerge. ").

description("https://birdeden.com/penguin-life-cycle", life_cycle, "penguin", "::stage Adult:: An adult penguin can reproduce only when they are between 3 and 8 years old, but normally penguins start breeding at the age of five. Smaller penguin species tend to reach sexual maturity earlier than the larger penguin species. Larger penguin species like King Penguin can breed twice in three years as they have 16 months of breeding cycle, whereas a little penguin can breed anytime throughout the year. All of them come on bare ground to lay eggs, while the Emperor penguins lay eggs on ice. In the month of March, the penguins travel 90-100 km inland in search of the 'perfect site' for breeding. It is a very risky journey, because those who are left behind, fall prey to predators or may even die of starvation. When the pengunis have finalized a site, in April they start mating. The penguins find their soulmates through singing and it is up to the males to attract females, and the females choose their partners accordingly. Penguins are monogamous creatures as they live with the same partner throughout their life. ::stage Egg:: A few weeks after mating, the female penguin lays 1 or 2 eggs. After laying eggs the females transfer the eggs to their male partners. In June-July, the males place the egg on their feet and incubate it. This transfer is the most important phase because, if the eggs break they can mate only in the next year, but usually during this transfer almost 20% of eggs break. The females search for food while the males incubate the eggs and wait for the partner to return. And once the female penguin returns, the penguins exchange their roles; the female incubates the egg while the male goes for food hunting. This is the most unique feature in the penguin's life cycle. In no other species of animals or birds are the fathers known to take care of their little ones. The penguin fathers are very loving, they fast for almost two months till their female partners return. During cold winds they form a close circle, to save heat for their offspring. ::stage Chick:: The eggs hatch sometime near August. It takes three days to hatch the eggs and as soon as the juvenile (baby penguin) comes out of its egg it starts calling, so that the parents learn to recognize the voice. The chicks are either brown or black in color and they have feathers that are not waterproof, so the juvenile penguin stays on land until it gets mature. During this time (in the month of September) the females return and feed the chicks by regurgitating while the males go for feeding. The male and female take turns to feed the chicks. This is repeated almost six times. It takes seven weeks to thirteen months for the chick to develop and get the waterproof feathers. When the chick is strong enough, both the parents go together for feeding. The adult penguin is no more dependent on its parents and hunts for food on its own. Finally in the month of December the families leave for the sea. One advantage of this cycle is, by the time the chicks are ready to swim, it is summer and the sea is abundant with food. In the next year, the same cycle is repeated; the adults start their journey, while the young ones stay on the shore. ").

The womb is where the wolf begins growing inside its mother's belly. The gestation period lasts between 60 and 63 days. During the gestation period, body parts form, including the eyes, nose, head, arms, legs, and so on. While the baby wolf is growing inside its mother's womb, his or her parents hunt for or dig a den. A den is a wild animal's hidden habitat, such as a cave or a hole in the ground. ::stage Wolf Pup:: Wolf pups are usually born in a litter, or a group of baby animals, four to six at a time. They're born with their eyes shut and usually weigh around one pound. It takes about 10-14 days for wolf pups' eyes to open. Can you imagine not being able to see for ten days? Wolf pups' grow at a very fast rate. At two weeks, wolf pups are able to walk around, although clumsily. By three weeks, they venture out of the den for the first time. Around this time, wolf pups' ears open and they begin to hear. Between five and ten weeks, wolf pups learn to socialize and identify other members of the wolf pack. They also learn to play, hunt, and even pretend fight with their litter mates. ::stage Juveniles:: Wolf pups turn into juvenile wolves by the age of three months and begin adventuring out with adult wolves and on their own. By nine months, juvenile wolves have learned how to hunt and capture a small prey of their own. When juvenile wolves reach two years of age, they're ready to mate and reproduce, or make their own wolf pups. Take a minute to think about that: if you were a 2-year-old wolf, you'd be ready to have and take care of your own family. ::stage Adult:: At the age of three years, a wolf is fully mature and classified as an adult. An adult wolf is intelligent, has strong problem-solving skills, and knows how to use the resources around it to survive. ").

There may be only one egg or thousands of eggs in that egg sac, depending on the kind of spider. Egg sacs act like force fields, protecting them from being harmed and from animals and insects that want to snack on them. Some spider moms carry their egg sacs with them or nestle them into safe spaces that they can protect, the way your family cares for you. Other kinds of spider moms leave the egg sacs on their own and hope that they survive and hatch. ::stage Spiderling:: After the spiderlings hatch, they hang out inside the egg sac until they finish their first molt. Spiders don't have a skeleton like you do, but they have a hard, outer casing called an exoskeleton. Although spiders get bigger, their exoskeleton doesn't grow with them and gets too small, the way you outgrow your shoes. So spiders have to shed it, or molt. A new, bigger exoskeleton is underneath. It is soft at first but hardens up, protecting the spiderling, which looks like a tiny version of an adult spider. After the first molt, the spiderlings leave the egg sac and huddle together for a short time. Although you live with your family as you grow up, these spider siblings don't hang out together for very long. Some kinds of spiderlings just walk off and go their own way, but others have more creative ways to travel. Some spiderlings leave by bridging. Spiderlings hike up into the leaves of a tree and then drop down onto nearby branches using a silk strand like a zip line. Other spiderlings go on their way by ballooning. Spiderlings climb to a high point on a nearby plant and shoot out silk strands that catch the wind like a kite. Then the spider floats away as if it was being carried by helium balloons. Spiders may float for a few feet up to several miles. ::stage Adult Spider:: After the spiderlings molt several times, they become fully grown adult spiders, which look like bigger versions of the small spiderlings. Some adult spiders stop molting after they stop growing while others molt from time to time throughout their life. As adults, they lay eggs and start the spider life cycle all over again. ").

For most grizzly bears, mating season runs from May into the first part of June. The female becomes sexually mature and able to have cubs between 4 1/2 and 10 years of age, notes the Bear Aware British Columbia website. Most females will breed once every three to four years, as it requires a few years to integrate their cubs into the world. ::stage Gestation:: The bear gestation period varies between 180 and 266 days. The embryo's development goes on hold temporarily at first, as the female gorges herself on whatever foods are available during the summer and autumn to develop a layer of fat off to live on through the winter months. The female chooses the site of her den, often under a log, in a cave or in a hollow tree. The female will then proceed to enter a sort of stupor that is not a true hibernation, with her body temperature, heart rate and breathing all reduced. Once the female is in this state, the embryo starts to develop once more, with the female giving birth to one to four cubs no later than March. ::stage Cub:: The newborn cub lacks fur and cannot see until it's a few days old. Although the young cease suckling from the mother by about the age of five months, they will continue to stay with her for as long as three years. The cubs need her protection from predators such as other bears, cougars and wolves. The grizzly cub has the ability to climb trees with ease until it is about a year old. The mother provides the meals with her foraging and hunting skills. ::stage Young adult:: Once the cubs are capable of fending for themselves, the mother will drive them away from her and look to breed again. By this time the young grizzly weighs between 350 to 700 lbs. depending on the abundance of food. As these bears grow in size and strength, their diet will expand as they start to possess the ability to kill larger prey. These male grizzlies will wait until they reach their sexual maturity before they breed, with some mature at 4 years old and others needing as much as 18 more months to reach full adulthood. In the meantime, they will establish their own territories as they age. ").

Unlike the eggs of some other parasites, flea eggs are not sticky and usually fall to the ground immediately upon being laid. Flea eggs hatch into larvae within one to 12 days. ::stage Larvae:: Flea larvae are approximately 3 to 5.2 mm long and are semitransparent white in color. The larval stage lasts from four to 18 days, after which larvae spin silken cocoons and enter the pupal stage. The pupal stage may be complete within three days, or it can last as long as one year. Flea larvae hatch from eggs that were laid by a female flea and have fallen off the animal host. Once away from the host, the larvae seek out shaded locations such as cracks in the floor, in carpets, in pet bedding or protected locations under and in furniture. Flea larval survival depends on relative humidity and temperatures. Since dehydration is fatal to flea larvae, they will not survive relative humidity less than 45-50 percent or soil temperatures greater than 95 degrees Fahrenheit. However, if outdoor larvae will survive in cool, shaded areas and do very well in crawl spaces. In environments of suitable humidity and temperatures, fleas will develop year round. Flea larvae complete three larval instars (stages) and, depending on their environment, will range in length from about 3-5 mm long. Flea larvae have no eyes and no legs. Their body is maggot-like and whitish, but turns progressively darker as the larvae feeds on feces excreted by the adult fleas. Other than feces, larvae will feed on various types of organic matter such as food particles, dead skin, dead insects and feathers. Flea larvae do not take a blood meal directly from a host, unlike adult fleas. The flea's larval stage is completed within about 4-18 days. One of the last activities of flea larvae is to spin a silken cocoon and then enter the pupal stage. Controlling flea larvae usually involves using vacuums to remove, use of insect growth regulators and dust formulations that cause desiccation of the larvae. Adult fleas begin searching for food when they emerge from the pupal stage. While fleas are noted for their jumping abilities, they will remain stationery when a suitable host is located. Females begin laying eggs within 48 hours of the first feed, thus beginning the life cycle again. Cold environments cause eggs to perish before hatching. Humidity below 45 percent will kill larvae. Fleas in the pupal stage will become adults more rapidly in the presence of warmth and high humidity. ").

It will take around one to four weeks for an egg to hatch and the larva to emerge. ::stage Larva:: The second stage of life lasts about eight to ten weeks and is spent as a brown larva. This is the stage where the insect is a mealworm. When first hatched, the larva is quite small but will grow to one to one and a half inches long. Since the mealworm has a hard exoskeleton, the worm will need to molt and shed its hard outer shell in order to grow. Molts will occur ten to twenty times during this stage of life. A recently molted worm will be soft and white, but the exoskeleton will quickly harden. A mealworm spends its time eating and growing in order to save up energy for the next transformation. ::stage Pupa:: During a mealworm's last molt it will turn into a white alien-like pupa. The pupa has no mouth or anus so does not eat. The pupa does have leg and wing buds, but they do not function. The pupa is quite helpless and the only movement it can do is wiggle. This stage of life will last one to three weeks as the pupa transforms its organs and body into an adult. ::stage Adult:: The final stage of the insect's life is as the darkling beetle and lasts one to three months. The beetle will be white with a soft exoskeleton. As the outer shell hardens, the beetle will turn brown and then black. The beetle does have hard wings, but it is unable to fly. After about one to two weeks of adult life, beetles will begin to mate and reproduce. A few days after mating, female beetles will burrow into soil or substrate and lay eggs. Darkling beetles are prolific breeders and females can lay hundreds of eggs during their adult lives. ").

These eggs will 'incubate' for a certain amount of time depending on the type of salmon and the temperature of the water. During this process, the salmon inside the egg develops its eyes, spine and tail. Once this process is complete, the egg will hatch and the salmon begins its life. ::stage 2.Alevin:: Once the egg hatches, the salmon enters the alevin stage. The alevins are still quite small and remain in the gravel beds safe from predators. Salmon in the alevin stage have a noticeable orange yolk sac attached to their bodies that provide nutrients. As the nutrients in the yolk sac are depleted toward the end of the alevin stage, the salmon develop their mouths and small oval-shapes on their sides. After this process, the alevin start to move away from the gravel beds to look for food. ::stage 3.Fry:: The fry stage begins once the salmon leaves the gravel beds where they were born. Salmon in the fry stage have noticeable 'parr' marks  that conceal the fish from predators. Although fry stage salmon have a lot of energy, they typically stay in slower moving waters and feed on plankton and insect larvae. How long a salmon stays in the fry stage depends on the species - some are only there for a short time while others like the King will stay for up to a year. ::stage 4.Smolt:: Once the 'parr' marks start wearing away and the salmon starts moving toward saltwater, it enters the smolt stage. Fish in this smolt stage are growing quite rapidly. Smolts typically stay in the brackish waters at the mouth of a river. Again, how long Smolts stay in this stage and how big they are varies by species. Once the Smolts reaches a certain size, they are ready to migrate into the open ocean and begin their adult life. ::stage 5.Adult:: Salmon are considered 'adults' when they complete the migration from freshwater to saltwater. The adults will feed in the open-ocean for a certain length of time depending on the species. King salmon for example will stay in the ocean for 6 years whereas Pink salmon will stay for about two before heading back to freshwater to spawn. ::stage 6.Spawner:: At a certain point, the salmon will begin migrating back to freshwater where they enter the spawner stage. Salmon in the spawner stage undergo tremendous physical changes, including their color. Sockeye, King and Silver salmon for example will change from a silvery greyish color to maroon or red. The jaws of male salmon will also change to a hook shape, which is known as a 'kype'. Pink and Sockeye males will also develop a defined hump on their back. Interestingly, salmon in the spawner stage will migrate back to almost the same exact spot where they were born. Species like the Chum salmon will migrate up to 2000 miles to spawn! The distance they go depends on the species and the river. Upon reaching the gravel beds, the females will lay their eggs in the gravel while the males fertilize them with something called 'milt'. This spawning 'run' occurs during the summer months and provides the best fishing opportunities. However, determining the exact time this occurs isn't easy. In most Alaskan rivers, the King salmon arrive first, then the Sockeye, Pinks, Chums and Silver in that order. ::stage 7.Post-spawn:: If a salmon makes it to the spawning grounds without getting caught or eaten by a predator, they will complete the breeding process as described in number 6. Once this process is over, the adult salmon die off and therefore complete the life cycle. ").

After two dragonflies mate, the female dragonfly will lay her eggs on a plant in the water, or if she can't find a suitable plant she will just drop them into the water. ::stage Nymph:: Once the dragonfly eggs hatch, the life cycle of a dragonfly larva begins as a nymph. A nymph looks like a little alien creature. Nymph hasn't grown its wings yet and has what looks like a crusty hump hanging onto its back. Dragonfly nymphs live in the water while they grow and develop into dragonflies. This portion of the dragonfly life cycle can take up to four years to complete, and if the nymph cycle is completed in the beginning of the wintertime, it will remain in the water until spring when it is warm enough to come out. Dragonfly nymphs live in ponds or marshy areas because the waters are calmer than in a stream or river. Sometimes they can be found in the calmer backwaters of rivers, too. Dragonfly nymphs may eat smaller dragonfly nymphs as they develop. ::stage Adult:: Once the nymph is fully grown, and the weather is right, it will complete the metamorphosis into a dragonfly by crawling out of the water up the stem of a plant. The nymph will shed its skin onto the stem of the plant and will then be a young dragonfly. The skin that the nymph left behind is called the exuvia and you can find the exuvia still stuck to the stem for a long time after the dragonfly has left it. Once the dragonfly leaves the exuvia it is a full grown dragonfly. The dragonfly will hunt for food and begin to look for a mate. Once the dragonfly finds a mate, the female will find a body of calm water that will be a good place to lay her eggs, and the life cycle of the dragonfly begins all over again. Adult dragonflies only live about two months. ").

Scalloped hammerhead females gather together in big schools. Males seek them out for breeding, and during the actual mating process the sharks stop swimming and sink until they break apart and begin to swim again. The great hammerhead doesn't always follow the same mating behavior as the others and has been spotted breeding near the water's surface. A pair was observed in the Bahamas circling each other and swimming up from the bottom to complete their mating at the top of the water. ::stage Gestation:: Hammerhead sharks gestate their young for nine to 11 months, depending on the species. The female will have between four and 42 babies, called pups, which are born alive and able to care for themselves. Baby hammerheads have more rounded cephalofoils than adults, making it easier for birthing. As they emerge from their mother the young quickly swim away to avoid becoming her next meal. ::stage Juveniles:: Young hammerheads eat a diet similar to the adults of their species, including fish, octopuses, crabs, lobsters and squid. Since larger sharks will eat the small ones, juvenile hammerheads must be quick to hide until they are large enough to be safe from most ocean predators. These sharks reach sexual maturity at different points in their lives, depending on species and on environment and growth rate. Female scalloped hammerheads are sexually mature when they reach about 6 feet in length, usually at around 15 years of age. Males mature much sooner, sexually active once they are about 4.5 feet long, usually by the age of 6. ::stage Adults:: Great hammerheads are the largest of the hammerheads, growing up to 20 feet long and weighing as much as 1,000 pounds. Their life spans average 20 to 30 years. Scalloped hammerheads, named for the series of grooves along the front of their snouts, are about half that size, reaching 8 to 10 feet long and typically weighing between 250 and 350 pounds. Life span estimates for the scalloped hammerhead vary, but the oldest one studied was believed to be at least 31 years old when caught. ").

The foetus totally depends on its mother as it cannot breathe, drink or eat by itself. ::stage baby:: After nine months in the mother's womb, the baby is born. Babies from birth to 1 year are also known as infants. Newborn babies can breathe, suck, swallow and cry when they feel hungry, cold and hot temperatures or any uncomfortable situation. This is how babies communicate as they still cannot talk. Babies are usually fed on mother's milk. ::stage childhood:: The baby grows into a child. The child slowly learns to crawl and then walk, talk, run, jump, eat by itself, identify things in its surroundings, communicate properly, read and write, make friends and do many more childhood activities. In the stage childhood, children can be divided into; toddlers (1-3 years), preschoolers (3-5 years) and primary school children (5-12 years). ::stage adolescence:: At the stage, adolescence, the child grows into an adolescent through a period called Puberty. Puberty usually takes place in the child's teenage years, starting from 13 years up to 19 years of age. Therefore, adolescents are also called teenagers. During the puberty a rapid growth and changes of the body take place. These include changes of the body shape, growing hair on some parts of the body, for example, boys grow hair on their faces, and also, boys' voice becomes deepen and rough. Similarly, at this adolescence stage the behaviour patterns and attitudes of the teenagers will change as they are independent in doing their day-to-day activities. ::stage adulthood:: People who are from age 20 years to 65 years old are called adults. Adults can reproduce, make their own families and so continue the life cycle. Adults can be divided into; young adults (20 - 36 years), middle-aged adults (36 - 55 years) and older adults (55 - 65 years). ::stage old person:: When a person reaches 65 years of age, he is known as an old or elderly person. The average life expectancy of a person can vary from 70 to 85 years. But it totally depends on the health of each person, as some die before 70 years, whereas some die after 85 years. However, the human life cycle ends at this stage. ").

Inside these tiny eggs, caterpillars grow. Depending on the species, the eggs can vary in shape and texture - they can be round, oval or cylindrical, and smooth, bumpy or wrinkled. The time it takes for the eggs to hatch can also vary - in some species, they will hatch within a few weeks and in others they will only hatch once the weather is warm enough. ::stage caterpillar:: Once ready, the caterpillar leaves its egg home and enters the big outside world! And these little critters have one serious appetite - the caterpillars actually eat their way out of the egg and immediately start chomping on the leaves of the host plant. During this stage, they shed their skin four or five times - as the caterpillar grows, its skin becomes too tight and splits open, revealing a new, larger skin underneath. A fully grown caterpillar can be over 100 times larger than when it emerged from its egg. Wow! ::stage pupa:: Once fully grown, the caterpillar forms itself into a 'pupa' (or chrysalis) - a kind of vessel in which the caterpillar changes into a butterfly. The caterpillars usually do this on twigs or safe, hidden areas around the host plant. The 'pupa' stage may last a few weeks to several months depending on the species. During this time, a hardened case forms around the pupa to protect it from predators and extreme weather conditions. And inside, the tissue, limbs and organs of the caterpillar transform. The result? A wonderful winged butterfly! ::stage adult:: Once the butterfly is ready to emerge, the case around the pupa splits open. But it's not time for the adult butterfly to take off just yet, as the wings are at first wet, soft and wrinkled against its body. The butterfly waits for its wings to dry, and pumps a liquid called hemolymph into them so that they become big and strong. Once fit for flight, this brilliant bug then takes to the air in search for flowers to feed on and for other butterflies to mate with. And that's the cycle complete - and ready to start all over again! ").

description("http://seagrant.mit.edu/hatchery/lifecycle.html", life_cycle, "fish", "::stage Egg:: The development of marine finfish eggs is temperature dependent among all teleost (bony fish). Once the egg is fertilized, the embryo will form inside the hardened egg. The embryo will start to develop organs, and eventually eyespots and the tail can be seen inside the egg. The embryo will develop pigmentation spots along the body. The tail will wrap around the egg to the head. If the species lives in warmer waters, the embryo will hatch more quickly. Colder water species hatch slowly, and the eyes and pigmentation will be fully developed at hatching. The tail of the embryo will break out of the shell and the embryo becomes a free-swimming larva. ::stage Larva:: Once the fish is hatched, it is known as a larva. Newly hatched larvae have a yolk sac that is a source of nutrition for the larvae. Larvae absorb their yolk sac for several days until they are developed enough to feed on live prey. Yolk sac larvae can survive for 2-4 days by feeding off their yolk sac food supply. This is called endogenous feeding. The length of the yolk sac period for larvae is dependent on the culture temperature and the species of fish. The warmer the water, the faster the fish will use up their yolk reserves. Once the larvae mouth has formed and the eyes are partially developed, the larvae can be offered a live feed. Feeding on organisms or particles in the water column is called exogenousfeeding. Live feed is essential to the early stages of developing larvae. Because their eyes are underdeveloped at hatch, the larvae need to be offered a feed that is moving around to help stimulate a feeding response. When the larvae hatch, they have a finfold around their whole body that looks like an outline when observed under a microscope. This finfold will eventually develop into fins, beginning with the process of metamorphosis. ::stage Juvenile:: Metamorphosis is the process that signifies the end of the larval stage. After metamorphosis, the fish are considered juveniles and will acquire characteristics of an adult fish: body features, coloration, fins, etc. Metamorphosis also denotes full organ development; it occurs at different times for different types of fish. For example, some fish will metamorphose in 20 days, whereas some will not go through the process until 4 months of age. Metamorphosis is a very stressful time for the fish, which means there is a point of high mortality, known as a bottleneck. The larvae are given a different type of feed during this period because they are now juvenile fish. Weaning fish to a new diet is also a stressful part of the culture process. Juveniles are usually resistant to stress (temperature, water quality, etc.) over time. As long as the culture environment remains healthy, the fish should thrive on dry feed and show significant growth rates. Juveniles are not considered adults until they become sexually mature. The developmental cycle is complete once spawning to egg and larvae to juvenile and adult has been accomplished. ::stage Adult:: Adults are characterized by their ability to reproduce. ").

The lizards remain in the egg for approximately 12 to 24 hours to absorb the remaining yolk before emerging from the egg. A few species of lizards, including the Solomon Island and blue-tongued skink give birth to live young. ::stage Juvenile Lizards:: After hatching or birth, juvenile lizards are fully able to fend for themselves. In most species, lizard parents do not provide care or protection for the young. Juveniles grow into adults without any significant changes other than size. ::stage Adult:: Once fully grown, lizards are adults and may begin mating. The mating process varies by species. For example, the frilled lizard mates during the wet season between October and March. Males attract females by spreading their frill. After mating, females lay 8 to 23 eggs. Females may lay up to two clutches each breeding season. Green iguanas begin mating when they are approximately 16 months old. Mating occurs during the dry season, usually in the fall. Males attract females with their colors and displays such as head-bobbing and push-ups. Females lay a clutch of 12 to 30 eggs. ").

The mother penguin only lays one egg and then leaves it with the father penguin, just like on a tag team. Around May or June, she goes on a long hunting trip in the ocean, just the way your mom might go to the grocery store, except that the mother penguin is gone for about two months! The father penguin keeps the egg warm, or incubates (pronounced INK-you-baits) it, in the cold climate. But the father doesn't build a nest like the birds in your tree. The father penguin balances the egg on the top of his feet and covers it with a special flap of skin that acts like a blanket. And because the father penguin can't go out and find food with an egg on his feet, he doesn't eat for about four months, using his fat to survive! ::stage Baby Chicks:: When the mother returns in July, the father gives the newly hatched chick back to her. Now, it's fathers turn to go out and find some yummy snacks while the mother babysits.

These chicks still need to go through a molt when they grow their waterproof feathers. ::stage Adult:: After their adult feathers come in, they are waterproof and ready to go out swimming and fishing for themselves. Eventually, the adults will return to the ice, lay an egg and start the emperor penguin life cycle all over again. ").

A fertilized egg contains the yolk, amniotic fluid (egg white) and a small blood spot, which is the beginning of a new life. The blood spot, which is the embryo, will develop into a chick over a period of 21 days until it hatches. During the 48 hours prior to hatching, the chick will pull the yolk into its abdomen and use it as a food source for its first few days of life. ::stage Baby Chick:: Once a chick hatches, it no longer needs its mother. The chick does require water, special feed and chick grit to eat until it is 18 to 24 weeks old. After they are 18 to 24 weeks old, the birds are considered mature and are able to eat adult chicken feed. ::stage Adult Chicken:: According to Murray McMurray Hatchery, adult chickens begin laying eggs when they are between 5-7 months of age. The first eggs the adult chickens lay are smaller than they will be in the future. A chicken will lay eggs without a rooster, but they will not be fertilized without him. ").

A butterfly first starts out as an egg. A girl butterfly lays the eggs on a leaf. She lays the eggs really close together. The eggs are really small and round. About five days after the eggs are laid. A tiny worm-like creature will hatch from the egg. ::stage Caterpillar:: The second stage is the caterpillar. A caterpillar is sometimes called larve. A caterpillar is a long creature. It looks like a worm. Most caterpillars have a cool pattern. This pattern has stripes or patches. The caterpillar is hungry once it has hatched. The caterpillar starts to eat leaves and flowers. The caterpillar eats these all the time. The caterpillar first eats the leaf that it was born on. The caterpillar stage is the eating and growing stage. A caterpillar grows really fast. This is because the caterpillars eat a lot. A caterpillar is really small when it is born. The caterpillar starts to grow fast. This is because the caterpillar eats all the time. The caterpillar grows so fast that it becomes too big for its skin. So the caterpillar has to shed its old skin. The caterpillar then gets new skin. Caterpillars shed their skin four or more times while they are growing. A caterpillar shedding its outgrown skin is called molting. Caterpillars do not stay in this stage very long. While they are in this stage, all they do is eat. ::stage Chrysalis:: Stage three is the chrysalis. This is when the caterpillar is done growing. The caterpillar makes a chrysalis. Another name for a chrysalis is a pupa. The chrysalis is mostly brown or green. The chrysalis is the same color as the things around it. Things like the trees, leaves, or branches. This is so that other animals cannot see it. This protects them. This keeps them from getting hurt. Pupa is the resting stage. Pupa also is the changing stage. The caterpillar starts to changes. It starts to turn into a butterfly. It starts to look different. Its shape starts to change. It changes quickly. It then turns into a butterfly. All this happens in the chrysalis. This does not take a long time. ::stage Adult Butterfly:: In stage four, the chrysalis opens. Soon a butterfly comes out. A butterfly is sometimes called an imago. It is also called an adult. Butterflies are very colorful. When the butterfly first comes out its wings are damp. The wings are also soft. The wings are folded against its body. The butterfly is also very tired. So the butterfly rests. Once the butterfly has rested, it will be ready to start flying. It will start to pump blood into its wings. This is to get them working and flapping. After it does this, it can now learn to fly. Butterflies cannot fly good at first. They need a lot of practice. It does not take long for them to learn. They learn fast. When it can fly, it will go look for food. The butterfly will also go look for a mate. It will soon find a mate. It will then lay eggs. The lifecycle will start all over again. ").

The gestation period in most whale species is 11 to 16 months. Generally a single young is born, tail first likely in order to prevent drowning, and twins are very rare. The newborn calf is usually one-quarter to a third the length of the mother. The baby stage runs from birth until the calf is weaned, during which time the calf frequently nurses on the mother's nutrient rich milk. Baleen whales will wean their calves by their first summer when they are less than a year old, while toothed whales take up to three years to be completely weaned. Calves grow very rapidly, thanks to the extremely high proportion of fat and proteins contained in whale milk. ::stage Adolescent :: The adolescent or juvenile stage runs from the moment the calf is weaned to when it reaches sexual maturity. Again, this varies according to the species.Once weaned, juveniles start to mix with whales of the same age and gender. Male juvenile whales will form bachelor pods and leave their original pod. They will start searching for sexually mature cows, female whales, with whom to mate. Female juveniles also start exploring outside their pod, but they are more likely to return to their matriarchal pod or to their mother. ::stage Adult :: The adult whale stage starts when the whale reaches sexual maturity. This can occur between the ages of six and 13 years, varying dramatically depending on the species. Breeding often takes place seasonally in migrating species but in others it seems to occur through most of the year. In the adult stage, whales of both genders start searching for mates with whom to breed. Sexually mature whales migrate to warmer waters during winter to mate. This ensures that when adults return the next year, their calves will be born in more temperate conditions. Mating takes place every two to three years for the cow as her gestation period lasts for between 10 and 14 months. Some whales, like humpbacks can theoretically produce one calf each year, with a gestation period of 11-12 months, but this rarely ever happens as it would strain the mother too much to calve every year. See the migrating whales on their journey north in search of warmer waters in which to breed, and see them return with their calves in tow. Check out the best spots to see whales along the NSW coastline. ").

Over 40 weeks, the zygote grows into a fetus the size of a small watermelon. All this time, the fetus has been in its mother's womb. Now, it's time for the fetus to enter the world and begin the baby stage. ::stage Baby Stage:: The baby stage lasts from birth to age one. Babies can't walk or talk yet, so they cry to communicate when they need something. As they baby's body and brain grow, the baby will start to move around on their own. At 6-8 months old, most babies can sit up and crawl. By one year old, babies usually have several teeth and are trying to talk. ::stage Childhood Stage:: If you're 12 or younger, you're in the childhood stage right now! Ages 1-12 make up the childhood stage, and this is when a lot of changes happen with our brains. In the childhood stage, we learn how to talk in complete sentences, how to feed ourselves, and how to read and write. Childhood is probably the most important stage in the human life cycle. Everything you learn and the habits you pick up will usually stay with you for the rest of your life. ::stage Teenage Stage:: The teenage stage, ages 13-18, is when a lot of changes happen with our bodies. The time when these changes happen are called puberty. Hair starts to grow in places that never had it before, our voices change, and the shape of our bodies change. Being a teenager can be a little rough as you get used to your new self--but remember, it won't last forever! ::stage Adult Stage:: The adult stage is the longest of the human life cycle and lasts from ages 18 to 50. By the time you're in your mid-20s, your body will be settled and, for the most part, stop growing. You may be completely independent and even have babies of your own. ::stage Elderly Stage:: The elderly stage is the final phase of the human life cycle. Usually after age 50, our bodies begin to slow down, and we can't move as fast as we used to. The elderly may need help with walking or other daily activities. When our bodies completely stop functioning, we reach the end of our life cycle, called death. ").

The egg case adheres to the surface of its new location through the female's saliva. ::stage Nymph:: Under good conditions and optimal temperatures, immature cockroaches, also known as nymphs, will emerge within 24 to 38 days. As they grow, nymphs undergo metamorphosis. Nymphs do this by shedding their exoskeleton. By the time nymphs are adult roaches, this will happen 10 to 13 times. At each molt, nymphs appear more and more like adults. ::stage Adult:: After undergoing their final molt, they are equipped with wings and reproductive capabilities. This process spans between six months to over a year. American cockroaches live for approximately one year. ").

The larva become pupae (pronounced PEW-pee) and will rest inside their case for several months as their bodies change and grow long legs, wings and a hard outer shell called an exoskeleton. Once the rainy season starts and enough water drips through the soil to reach the now fully grown African goliath beetles, they crawl out of their cases in the soil and fly off. ::stage Adult:: Once they pop out of the ground and take off, adult African goliath beetles look for mates.

Deposited several feet below the water surface, they are protected from exposure to indirect sunlight. The eggs are spherical in shape and slightly translucent with pinkish or reddish coloration. While in the egg stage, the developing organs can be seen easily through the translucent covering. Hatching usually takes place within 2 - 3 months after the eggs are laid. ::stage Alevin:: The water flow and temperature are very crucial for hatching salmon eggs. Alevins, which are 1-inch long, are characterized by presence of abnormally large eyes, attached to a bright orange sac, which is nothing, but the nutritive yolk. For nearly 3 - 4 months, the newly hatched alevins reside in the gravel nest, feeding on the yolk that hangs below their body. ::stage Fry:: The next stage is that of fry. Once the nutritive yolk is absorbed, the young fry come out of the gravel nest. The young fry swim and feed on small planktons and aquatic plants. Many times, the salmon fry become easy prey for larger fish, insects, and birds. In their entire life, the mortality rate for salmons is highest when they are in the fry stage. ::stage Parr:: When a fry mature to parr stage, they measure about 6 inches. During this parr stage, vertical markings develop on their body and flanks. Species like king salmon immediately migrate to the oceans during or after fry stage. In other species, parr feed and grow in the freshwater streams for approximately 1 - 3 years, before they begin their journey towards the ocean. ::stage Smolt:: In the smolt stage, the developing salmons reach the estuary - the connecting point where a river meets an ocean. The smolts turn silvery white in color, while losing their vertical stripes. In general, they swim in groups along with others and frequently visit the oceans for feeding purpose. With time, smolts body gets adjusted to saline water of the ocean. ::stage Adult:: The body marking of adult salmons is very distinctive, which differs significantly from one type to another. Based on the species in question, adults may spend anywhere around 3 - 7 years in the ocean, after which they migrate upstream to their birthplace for spawning. Adult salmons stop eating and develop different body colors; males retain bright colors, while females turn darker. After mating, the adult female lays eggs in the spawning site, and the entire journey is repeated all over again. Salmons have an average lifespan of 7 years. Most of the species inhabiting the Pacific Ocean die immediately after spawning?a behavior referred to as 'semelparity'. Very few species have the ability to spawn repeated times. Overall, the mortality rate after spawning is very high (40 percent to be precise), as adult spawners cannot spend long time in freshwater. In a nutshell, a salmon egg hatches in a river, migrates to sea, and returns back in the river for spawning. ").

The eggs hatch from between 4 and 10 days depending on temperature and humidity. ::stage Larva:: The eggs hatch as clothes moth larvae - this is the destructive stage. The larvae are typically a few millimetres long upon hatching but then grow to 1-1.5cm in length, dependent on availability of food (i.e. your natural woollen and silk clothing or carpets as examples!) and moisture to help intake of water - they cannot 'drink' in a conventional sense and hence require humidity. This is why residual perspiration or food and drink stains on clothing attract moths. Clothes moth larvae can stay at this stage for up to 30 months (2 and 1/2 years!) happily eating your clothing whilst waiting for the right conditions to turn into adult moths. This is precisely why clothing moth issues persist through the winter, not just from the Spring when the adults tend to start flying. ::stage Pupa:: When the temperatures are right and the larvae have reached the right size, they then start the pupation stage where they spin a cocoon in which they metamorphose into the adult moth. This remarkable natural process typically takes 8 to 10 days. You may find the 'debris' from this stage in the form of used webbing cases from which the webbing clothes moth takes its common name. ::stage Adult:: The final part of the life cycle occurs when the adult clothes moth measuring about 1-1.5cm emerges from the cocoon. Whilst relatively harmless in their own right, the presence of adult clothes moths signals a potential infestation should they be allowed to lay their numerous eggs. The female adult clothes moth tends to hop or crawl - it is the male that flies more often in search of a mate. ").

In this stage, they're called nymphs because they look just like a smaller version of their parents. The nymphs stay living on their mother's back until their first molt, the shedding of the outer covering of their body. After this, the nymphs go to live on their own. Nymphs will molt another five to six times before reaching full adulthood. The purpose of molting is to grow. Since scorpions have a hard outer shell, it doesn't stretch and grow with them like your skin does. So, instead scorpions have to shed it once they are too big for it. Then the next shell is soft for a little while, to allow the scorpions to grow and stretch. Once this next outer shell is too small, the scorpions shed it and do the whole process again. ::stage 3:: The third stage is the adult. In the adult stage, they are fully grown. The adults are now able to hunt and feed themselves, without the help of their parents. The adults can also mate and reproduce. ").

By spring or early summer when the temperature is warm, the eggs hatch into nymphs. ::stage Nymph:: Immediately after hatching, the young nymphs (first instar nymphs) start feeding on soft and succulent plant foliage. Nymphs are miniature versions of adult grasshoppers, except that they are light in color and do not possess wings. Nymphs undergo 5 - 6 molts and change their form and structure, before becoming adults. The nymphal stage may last for a period of 5 - 10 days, based on the species and the weather condition, especially temperature and humidity. As the nymphs molt, their size increases and wing pads progressively develop on the thorax portion of the body. ::stage Adult:: After 25 - 30 days, the wings are developed completely and the nymphs mature into adults. Thus, by the time, an egg matures into an adult, the grasshopper is about eleven months old. The adults gain sexual maturity within 15 days, and survive for a span of about 30 days. As adults possess wings, they are more mobile than the nymphs, which benefit them in hunting food and protecting from the predators. However, it is observed that every stage of the grasshopper has some predators. ").

Once an egg is laid, one of two things can happen. If the egg is not fertilized, it makes its way to the grocery store. These are the eggs you enjoy for breakfast. If the egg is fertilized, then it takes about three weeks for the baby inside to be strong enough to hatch out of it. At first, the baby is covered with a very soft material called down, which makes the chick look fluffy. It takes about one to two months for a baby hen to develop its feathers. ::stage Young Chick:: When a hen is a young chick, it actually isn't called a hen yet. It is called a pullet. These pullets spend about six months hanging out around the farm. These pullets eat both plants and other animals, like mice and insects. This means the pullets are omnivores. After about six months, the pullet is old enough to start laying eggs of her own. Once that happens, she is no longer called a pullet. Now she is a full-grown hen. ::stage Adult Hen:: Once a hen is old enough, let the egg-laying begin! Hens breed with roosters in the spring and summer months, because there are long stretches of daylight during this time. Once a hen breeds with a rooster, she lays an egg in less than 24 hours. The hen sits on the egg to keep it warm, which helps the embryo, or beginning stage of the baby chicken, to develop. In three weeks, the chick hatches and the cycle starts all over again! ").
